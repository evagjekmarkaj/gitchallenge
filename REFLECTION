I am confident on creating new branches, switching between branches, reverting back in case I made a mistake when I committed something. Also confident on comparing files with git diff. 
 
Still confused on the merging of files when I edit different text files.  
When I moved to a new branch in the first few steps, the nextstep.pdf file kept disappearing. Does it always do that when I switch branches? 
Also a little confused on the git stash commands. I need to work more on and review documentation on merging files — I think that’s where I am the most confused.
